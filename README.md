RSpec Console
=============

RSpec Console allows you to run your RSpec tests in a Rails console.
Best served chilled with [irb-config](https://github.com/nviennot/irb-config).

It is especially helpful when working with [jRuby](http://jruby.org/), because it will keep an active JVM running for you. This drastically reduces the feedback loop of doing TDD in jRuby -- and all without messing with nail-gun!

Usage
------

### 1) Install rspec-console with:

```ruby
gem 'rspec-console'
```

### 2) With Rails, disable cache\_classes so reload! function properly

Ensure you turned off Rails's `cache_classes` in the config/environment/test.rb file:

```ruby
Rails.application.configure do
  # turn off this!
  config.cache_classes = false
end
```

### 3) Launch your console

With Rails, launch your console with `rails c test`.

### 4) Launch your tests

If you have [Pry](https://github.com/pry/pry) installed, you will have access to the `rspec` command
in your console, which works exactly like the shell command line rspec one.

If you don't have pry, you can use:

```ruby
RSpecConsole.run 'spec/integration/closing_brand_action_spec.rb:33' '--format=doc'
```

Example
-------

```
pafy@bisou ~/prj/sniper [master●] % rails c test
~/prj/crowdtap/sniper (test) > rspec spec/integration/closing_brand_action_spec.rb:33 --format=doc
Run options: include {:locations=>{"./spec/integration/closing_brand_action_spec.rb"=>[33]}}

Sniper

    no longer targets this brand action on members

* Get tests to 100% coverage. Currently at 106 / 118 LOC (89.83%) covered.
